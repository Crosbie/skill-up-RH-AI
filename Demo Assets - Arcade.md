# Demo Assets \- Arcade

1. [**Red Hat helps with AI Adoption**](https://interact.redhat.com/share/cgYsaBPDxWsGtbtf9bke)  
   * This demo asset illustrates how Red Hat's open hybrid cloud platform accelerates AI initiatives. It highlights the platform's ability to unify data, streamline MLOps, and provide consistent infrastructure for building, training, and deploying AI models across diverse environments. The demo emphasizes overcoming common challenges like fragmented data and slow deployment cycles, enabling organizations to rapidly innovate with AI and gain a competitive edge.

2. [**MaaS**](https://interact.redhat.com/share/Kogh3jIN25xozds7Tc2R)  
   * Provides a practical illustration of how the fictional company Parasol implements the Model-as-a-Service concept. It specifically demonstrates how Parasol makes a variety of AI models readily available to individuals throughout their organization. Crucially, the demo emphasizes that this broad accessibility is achieved while still maintaining essential control, robust monitoring capabilities, and comprehensive access logs for the underlying AI models. This ensures responsible and governed use of AI across the enterprise.

3. [**InstructLab: Training an LLM**](https://interact.redhat.com/share/eTE6P4AjFyVIeRxNZX1C)  
   * Focuses on the process of training a Large Language Model (LLM) with unique, proprietary data using InstructLab and Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI). It addresses the common challenge faced by organizations that traditionally find it difficult to customize language models for specific business applications without requiring highly specialized data scientists. The demonstration illustrates how this hurdle can be overcome by showcasing a method to train an LLM using synthetic data generation. This capability allows businesses to tailor powerful AI models to their unique datasets and use cases, even if they don't have extensive in-house data science expertise, thereby making LLM customization more accessible and efficient.  
   


4. [**Serving an LLM locally with InstructLab**](https://interact.redhat.com/share/hsViHFIgLO3MPBbWD1wi)  
   * Focuses on the capability of **hosting your own private and local AI model using InstructLab**. It highlights how users can leverage the command-line interface of the open-source InstructLab project on Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI) to achieve this. The key benefit emphasized is the ability to **run Large Language Models (LLMs) directly from your local machine, with a strong focus on data privacy**. This empowers users to maintain control over their data while utilizing powerful AI models, making it suitable for environments where data confidentiality is paramount.  
   


5. [**Red Hat AI at the Edge**](https://interact.redhat.com/share/mYz5cmOl3ePg7qxnkXgz)  
   * Focuses on how components of **Red Hat OpenShift AI** can be utilized to **automate the lifecycle of artificial intelligence models specifically at edge locations**. The description highlights two key features that enable this automation: **model serving and pipeline capabilities**. It addresses a critical challenge faced by edge environments, which often have limited or no dedicated IT support. To overcome this, the demo showcases how to achieve resilient and simple architectures that incorporate automated operations, thereby requiring minimal human intervention for AI model deployment and management at the edge.  
   


6. [**RHELAI and InstructLab\***](https://interact.redhat.com/share/tCzxg3N2kdcn7KFLXLk1)  
   * This demo asset provides a hands-on exploration of **Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI)**, specifically demonstrating its utility for enterprises looking to **develop applications utilizing open-source Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The demo illustrates how RHEL AI serves as a foundational platform for this kind of development. This demo highlights RHEL AI's role in empowering organizations to build and manage LLM-powered applications within an open and controlled environment.
